McKinsey & Company partnered with Goodwill Industries International and its network of 153 local nonprofit affiliates to strengthen career pathways for millions of Americans, particularly early-career job seekers and individuals facing barriers to employment. 
Traditional workforce development programs often consist of multiple optional services, leading to complexity and inconsistent outcomes. 
To address this, McKinsey worked with Goodwill to streamline the Opportunity Accelerator® framework, reducing over 35 optional services to a focused set of best-practice elements. 
These included simplified intake and assessment processes, mentorship-driven career coaching, and structured alumni engagement. Participants were connected to jobs with Goodwill’s employer partners and received ongoing mentorship and support. 
The partnership also created a roadmap for expanding Opportunity Accelerator’s reach beyond its current footprint, aiming to foster long-term career development, economic empowerment, and sustained job retention across large communities. 
This initiative helps create impactful pathways for individuals from all backgrounds to access meaningful employment and thrive in the modern economy.
